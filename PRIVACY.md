# Privacy Policy for AI Makeover

**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025

## Introduction

AI Makeover ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome Extension and associated services.

## Information We Collect

### 1. User-Provided Content
*   **Images**: When you use the "Magic Wand" feature, the image you select is temporarily processed to generate the new design.
*   **Prompts**: We collect the text prompts and style preferences you select to guide the AI generation.

### 2. Authentication Data
*   **Google Account Information**: We use Google OAuth to authenticate users. We access your email address and profile name solely for identification and rate-limiting purposes. We do not store your password.

### 3. Usage Data
*   We may collect anonymous usage data (e.g., number of images generated, errors encountered) to improve the extension's performance and reliability.

## How We Use Your Information

*   **To Provide the Service**: Images and prompts are sent to our backend and third-party AI providers (Google Gemini API) to generate the "makeover" results.
*   **No Permanent Storage of Images**: We do not store the images you upload or the images generated for the long term. They are processed in memory and returned to your browser.
*   **Authentication**: Your email is used to associate your usage with your account and prevent abuse of the service.

## Third-Party Services

*   **Google Gemini API**: We use Google's Generative AI services to process images. Data sent to this API is subject to Google's data handling policies.
*   **Google Cloud Platform**: Our backend services are hosted on Google Cloud.

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. Communication between the extension, our server, and third-party APIs is encrypted using HTTPS.

## Your Rights

You may revoke the extension's access to your Google Account at any time via your Google Account security settings.
